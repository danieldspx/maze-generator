# Maze Generator - Kruskal Algorithm

### Maze Generation and Path Finding Visualization:
Switch to `animation` branch to generate your own animations

The generation is using Kruskal's Algorithm for a minimum spanning tree and we modify it by choosing randomly an edge and not from an ordered list.

The path finding algorithm is A* with the heuristics being the euclidean distance between points.
